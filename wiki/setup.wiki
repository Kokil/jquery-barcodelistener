This guide will help you to seup and use correctly the BarcodeListener plugin for jQuery.

= Setup the scanner =
It is important to setup correctly your barcode scanner.
First of all you have to add some header characters to the output before the code. Most of scanners should do it. For example I set my scanner the header:
{{{
§~
}}}
these are not common characters. I did that because the BarcodeListener plugin listen every input but catch only the one that start whith these characters; so do not use letters or number that are really common when you write something.

The last point is to set the scanner to hit the ENTER button after the code to let the plugin read the code and lauch the user's function.

= Setup the plugin =

== Download ==
First of all download the [http://code.google.com/p/jqueryjs/downloads/list last version of jQuery] and the [http://code.google.com/p/jquery-barcodelistener/downloads/list last version of BarcodeListener].

== Include ==
Now you have to include the scripts in your HTML document. The code is:
{{{
<script type="text/javascript" src="[URL to jQuery code]"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="[URL to BarcodeListener code]"></script>
}}}


== Find your way ==
There are two ways to setup the plugin:
    * using the wizard (for beginners);
    * setting the plugin your own (for experts);

=== Setting the plugin your own ===
To call the plugin use this code:
{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function() {
	char0 = new Array("§", "32");
	char1 = new Array("˜", "732");
	char3 = new Array("§", "32");
	char2 = new Array("˜", "732");
	characters = new Array(char0, char1, char2, char3);
	$(document).BarcodeListener(characters, function(code) {
	    // YOUR FUNCTION HERE
            // for example:
            alert(code);
	});
    });
</script>
}}}
